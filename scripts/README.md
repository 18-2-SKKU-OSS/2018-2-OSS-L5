This directory contains scripts that:

* Generally do not require access to Django or the database (those are
  "management commands"), and thus are suitable to run operationally.

* Are useful for managing a production deployment of Zulip (many are
  also used in a Zulip development environment, though
  development-only scripts live in `tools/`).

For more details, see
