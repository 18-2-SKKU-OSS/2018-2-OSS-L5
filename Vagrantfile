# Workaround: the lxc-config in vagrant-lxc is incompatible with changes in
# LXC 2.1.0, found in Ubuntu 17.10 artful.  LXC 2.1.1 (in 18.04 LTS bionic)
# ignores the old config key, so this will only be needed for artful.
#
# vagrant-lxc upstream has an attempted fix:
#   https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-lxc/issues/445
# but it didn't work in our testing.  This is a temporary issue, so we just
# hack in a fix: we patch the skeleton `lxc-config` file right in the
# distribution of the vagrant-lxc "box" we use.  If the user doesn't yet
# have the box (e.g. on first setup), Vagrant would download it but too
# late for us to patch it like this; so we prompt them to explicitly add it
# first and then rerun.
