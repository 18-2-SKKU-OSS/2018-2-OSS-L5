usage: $0 PULL_REQUEST_ID [REMOTE]

Force-push our HEAD to the given GitHub pull request branch.

Useful for a maintainer to run just before pushing to master,
after tweaking the branch and/or rebasing to latest.  This causes
GitHub to see the subsequent push to master as representing a
merge of the PR, rather than requiring the PR to be manually
(and to the casual observer misleadingly) closed instead.

REMOTE defaults to the value of the Git config variable
\`zulip.zulipRemote\` if set, else to \`upstream\`.

See also \`reset-to-pull-request\`.
