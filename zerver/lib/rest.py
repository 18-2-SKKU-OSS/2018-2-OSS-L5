    Unauthenticated endpoints should not use this, as authentication is verified
    in the following ways:
        * for paths beginning with /api, HTTP Basic auth
        * for paths beginning with /json (used by the web client), the session token

    This calls the function named in kwargs[request.method], if that request
    method is supported, and after wrapping that function to:

        * protect against CSRF (if the user is already authenticated through
          a Django session)
        * authenticate via an API key (otherwise)
        * coerce PUT/PATCH/DELETE into having POST-like semantics for
          retrieving variables

    Any keyword args that are *not* HTTP methods are passed through to the
    target function.

    Never make a urls.py pattern put user input into a variable called GET, POST,
    etc, as that is where we route HTTP verbs to target functions.
