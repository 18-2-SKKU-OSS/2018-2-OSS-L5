{% if active_account_in_realm %}
Psst. Word on the street is that you need a new password, {{ email }}.

It's all good. Follow the link below and we'll take care of the rest:

{{ reset_url }}
{% else %}
{% if user_deactivated %}
Someone (possibly you) requested a password reset email for {{ email }}
on {{ realm_uri }}, but your account has been deactivated. You can contact
an organization administrator to reactivate your account.
{% else %}
Someone (possibly you) requested a password reset email for {{ email }}
on {{ realm_uri }}, but you do not have an account in that organization.
{% endif %}

{% if active_accounts_in_other_realms %}
You do have active accounts in the following organization(s).
{% for active_account in active_accounts_in_other_realms %}
{{ active_account.realm.uri }}
{% endfor %}
You can try logging in or resetting your password in the organization(s)
above.
{% endif %}

{% endif %}
