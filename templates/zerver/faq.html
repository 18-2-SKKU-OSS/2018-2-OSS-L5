                    Do you have special plans for open source projects,
                    non-profits, groups of friends, and other non-commercial
                    entities?
                </div>
                <p class="answer">
                    Yes! Zulip Cloud Standard is free for open source
                    projects and affiliated institutions. We also offer
                    steep discounts to non-profits, educational
                    institutions, groups of friends, and in scenarios where
                    most of the users are not paid employees (e.g. company
                    support forums). Just contact sales@zulipchat.com and
                    we&rsquo;d be happy to discuss your situation!
