1. Follow the **Getting Started with Hubot** section of the
   [Hubot README](https://hubot.github.com/docs/#getting-started-with-hubot)
   to create your Hubot. You'll have a new directory from
   which `bin/hubot` starts a vanilla Hubot instance with
   the shell backend.

2. In your Hubot's directory, install the Zulip adapter. Run:
   `npm install --save hubot-zulip`

3. On your {{ settings_html|safe }}, create a bot account. Note
   its username, API key and full name; you will use them on the
   next step.

4. To run Hubot locally, first, set the following environment
   variables by running:

```
export HUBOT_ZULIP_SITE="{{ api_url }}"
export HUBOT_ZULIP_BOT="hubot-bot@example.com"
export HUBOT_ZULIP_API_KEY="your_key"
```

Then, run:

`bin/hubot --adapter zulip --name "myhubot"`

The `--name` parameter must match the name you gave the bot on
the settings page.

Hubot will automatically listen for commands on all public streams.
You can also invite Hubot to private streams.

To test your Hubot installation, send it an @-notification with a
basic command, for example `@Hubot pug me`, which should produce a
result like this:
