# Make a user an administrator

{!admin-only.md!}

By default, users join as **members**, which gives them limited access to
organization-wide settings. An organization administrator can make any other
member an administrator, or revoke admin access from any other administrator.

1. Find the user you would like to manage. Click the **pencil**
(<i class="fa fa-pencil"></i>) to the right of their name.

1. Under **User role**, select **Administrator**, **Member** or **Guest**.

1. Click **Save changes**. The new rights will take effect immediately.

    Users can revoke their own administrative privileges if there is at least
    one other administrator in the organization.
