# Link to a message or conversation

Share permanent links to messages, threads, and streams. The Zulip project
uses this feature extensively to link to Zulip conversations from our
issue tracker.

## Link to a stream or topic (web only)

1. Click on a stream or topic in the left sidebar.

1. Copy the URL from your browser's address bar.

!!! tip ""
    This works for all views, including searches.
    All URLs in Zulip are permalinks.

## Link to a specific message

{!message-actions-menu.md!}

1. Click **Link to conversation**.

The copied link will take you to the topic of the relevant message, scrolled
down to that message.
