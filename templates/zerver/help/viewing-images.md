# Viewing images

When someone pastes or attaches an image to a message, Zulip shows a small
preview.

To **view the image at full size**, click on the image preview. This opens a
special image viewer. From there, you can **pan and zoom**, or **download**
the original image.

You can **exit the image viewer** by clicking anywhere outside the image.

    Use `v` to **open** the image viewer. Use `Z` and `z`
    zoom in and out of the image. Use `v` or `Esc` to **close**.

## See all images in a narrow

Click on any image in the narrow. From there, you can use arrow keys or the
navigation bar at the bottom to browse all images in the narrow.

## Troubleshooting

To open the image viewer, you must click on the image preview, not the file name.
