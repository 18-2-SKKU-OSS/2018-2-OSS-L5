# Change a user's name

{!admin-only.md!}

By default, users can [change their name](/help/change-your-name), though
organization administrators can
[restrict name changes](/help/restrict-name-and-email-changes).

Organization administrators can always change any user's name.

1. Find the user you would like to manage. Click the **pencil**
(<i class="fa fa-pencil"></i>) to the right of their name.
