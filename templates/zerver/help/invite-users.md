# Invite users

By default, users need an invitation to join your Zulip organization, and
all members other than guests can invite others.

Organization administrators can also
[modify who can join and invite](/help/manage-who-can-join-and-invite) in a
variety of ways.

{relative|gear|invite}

1. Enter a list of **email addresses**, decide whether the new users should
   **join as admins, members, or guests**, and select the **streams they should join**.

1. Click **Invite**.

!!! warn ""
    You will only see **Invite users** in the gear menu if you have
    permission to invite users.

## Default streams

If you're frequently adding users to your organization, you may want to
[set default streams for new users](/help/set-default-streams-for-new-users).
