# Manage who can join and invite

{!admin-only.md!}

By default, users need an invitation to join. You can additionally
**allow only administrators to send invitations**.

Alternatively, you can **allow anyone to join without an invitation**. In
this case, you can also **disallow disposable email addresses**, or
**restrict new users to a list of email domains** (e.g. `corp.example.com`, or `*.example.com`).

{settings_tab|organization-permissions}

1. Under **Joining the organization**, configure **Are invitations required for joining the organization**.

1. Under **Joining the organization**, configure **Restrict email domains of new users**.
