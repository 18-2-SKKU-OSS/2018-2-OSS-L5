# Enable Enter to send

By default, the `Enter` (or `Return`) key adds a new line to a message,
and `Ctrl+Enter` sends the message.

This is convenient for typing multi-line messages, which are more common in
Zulip than in most other chat products. However, you can also configure
Zulip so that `Enter` sends the message.

Note that `Shift+Enter` always adds a new line, regardless of whether
**Enter to send** is enabled. The full table is below.
