# Change the privacy of a stream

{!admin-only.md!}

Streams can be public or private, and private streams can have shared or
protected history. See [stream permissions](/help/stream-permissions) for
details on stream privacy settings.

As an organization administrator, you can always make a public stream
private, but you must be subscribed to a private stream in order to make it
public.

    Be careful making a private stream public. All past messages will become
