# Disable message edit history

{!admin-only.md!}

By default, Zulip displays messages that have been edited with an EDITED tag, and users
can [view the edit history of a message](/help/view-a-messages-edit-history).

To remove the edit history of a single message, it is usually best to
[delete the message](edit-or-delete-a-message) entirely. However, you can
also disable viewing of message edit history more generally.

{settings_tab|organization-settings}

2. Under **Message editing**, uncheck **Enable message edit history**.
