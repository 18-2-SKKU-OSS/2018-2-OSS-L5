# PMs, mentions, and alerts

You can configure desktop, mobile, and email notifications for private
messages, @-mentions, and alert words.

{settings_tab|notifications}

1. Toggle the notification settings under **Private messages and @-mentions**.

These settings will affect notifications for private messages, group private
messages, @-mentions, and alert words. The one exception is that we never
send email notifications for `@all` or `@everyone` mentions.

You can also hide the content of private messages (and group private
messages) from desktop notifications.
Under **Visual desktop notifications**, uncheck
**Include content of private messages**.
