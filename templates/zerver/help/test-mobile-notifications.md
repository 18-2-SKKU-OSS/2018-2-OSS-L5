# Test mobile notifications

Normally, mobile notifications are only sent if you're idle, which isn't
ideal for testing.

You can instead have mobile notifications sent for all private messages,
regardless of whether you're on-line.

{settings_tab|notifications}

1. Under **Private messages and @-mentions**, enable
   **Mobile notifications when offline**.

1. Under **Private messages and @-mentions**, enable
   **Mobile notifications always**.
