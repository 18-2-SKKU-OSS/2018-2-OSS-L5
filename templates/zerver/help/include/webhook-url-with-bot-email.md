In the URL field, enter:

`{{ external_uri_scheme }}bot_email:bot_api_key@{{ api_url_scheme_relative }}{{ integration_url }}`

Replace `bot_email` and `bot_api_key` above with the URL-encoded email
address and API key of the bot.  To URL-encode the email address, you
just need to replace `@` in the bot's email address with `%40`.
