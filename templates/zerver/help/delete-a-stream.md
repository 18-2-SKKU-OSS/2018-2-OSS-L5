# Delete a stream

{!admin-only.md!}

Deleting a stream will immediately unsubscribe all users from the stream,
remove the stream from search and other typeaheads, and remove the stream's
messages from **All messages**.

Deleting a stream does not delete a stream's messages. Users will still be
able to find any given message by searching for it. However, links to
messages and topics in the stream may or may not continue to work.

In most cases, we recommend [renaming streams](/help/rename-a-stream) rather
than deleting them.
