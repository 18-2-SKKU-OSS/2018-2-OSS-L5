# Emoji and emoticons

## Add emoji to a message

There are several ways to add emoji to a message: typing emoji codes,
selecting from an emoji picker, using emoticons, or pasting unicode.

### Type an emoji code

1. Type `:` followed by a few letters to open the emoji autocomplete. The
   letters don't have to be at the beginning of the emoji name; `:ppl` will
   match `:apple:`

If you don't know the code for an emoji, you can see what it's called in the
emoji picker, or hover over the emoji in a message.

### Select from the emoji picker

1. Click the smiley face (<i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i>) icon at the
   bottom of the compose box.

1. Select an emoji. You can type to search, use the arrow keys, or click on
   an emoji with your mouse.

### Use emoticons

[Enable emoticon translations](/help/enable-emoticon-translations), and then
type away :). That link also has the list of supported emoticons.

### Paste unicode

Copying and pasting emoji from other apps generally works.
