# Check whether someone is here or away

You can check a user's status in the **user list** in the right sidebar.

* A green circle (<span class="indicator green solid"></span>) means the
  user is “active” — they have interacted with Zulip in the last few
  minutes, and have Zulip open on their computer.

* An orange half-filled circle (<span class="indicator orange"></span>)
  means the user is not active, but has Zulip open on their computer.

* A white circle (<span class="indicator grey"></span>) means the user does
  not have Zulip open.

!!! tip ""
    You can also view a user's status by clicking on their profile
    picture in the main message feed.

If you have messaged users in a group PM, their names will appear at the
bottom of the right sidebar. In that case, a green circle (<span
class="indicator green solid"></span>) means all users in the group are
active. A pale green circle (<span class="indicator green"></span>) means
that some are active and some are not. A white circle (<span
class="indicator grey"></span>) means that none are active.

## Small windows

The right sidebar only appears in windows more than 1025 pixels wide. You can also
[move the user list to the left sidebar](/help/move-the-users-list-to-the-left-sidebar).
