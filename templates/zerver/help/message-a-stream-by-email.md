# Message a stream by email

This can be useful if you want to copy an email into Zulip. If you're
planning on doing this in an automated way, consider using our
[send message API](/api/send-message).

{relative|stream|subscribed}

1. Select a stream.

1. Copy the email address under **Email address**.

1. Send an email to that email address.

The email subject will become the Zulip topic, and the email body will
become the Zulip message.

!!! warn ""
    If you don't see the **Email address** section, most likely your server
    administrator has not configured the **EMAIL GATEWAY INTEGRATION** section
    of `/etc/zulip/settings.py`.
