# Import from Slack (beta)

Starting with Zulip 1.8, Zulip supports importing data from Slack,
including users, channels, messages, attachments, avatars, custom
emoji, and emoji reactions.

**Note:** You can only import a Slack workspace as a new Zulip
organization. In particular, you cannot use this tool to import from Slack
into an existing Zulip organization.

## Import from Slack

First, export your data from Slack.

1. [Export your Slack data](https://my.slack.com/services/export). You will
   receive a zip file `slack_data.zip`.

    !!! warn ""
        **Note:** Only Slack owners and admins can export data from Slack.
        See Slack's
        [guide to data exports](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/201658943-Export-data-and-message-history)
        for more information.

2. [Generate a Slack API token](https://api.slack.com/custom-integrations/legacy-tokens).

### Import into zulipchat.com

Email support@zulipchat.com with `slack_data.zip`, the Slack API token
generated above, and your desired subdomain. Your imported organization will
be hosted at `<subdomain>.zulipchat.com`.

If you've already created a test organization at
`<subdomain>.zulipchat.com`, let us know, and we can rename the old
organization first.

### Import into a self-hosted Zulip server

First
[install a new Zulip server](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/production/install.html),
skipping "Step 3: Create a Zulip organization, and log in" (you'll
create your Zulip organization via the data import tool instead).

Log in to a shell on your Zulip server as the `zulip` user. To import with
the most common configuration, run the following commands, replacing
`<token>` with the value generated above.

```
cd /home/zulip/deployments/current
./manage.py convert_slack_data slack_data.zip --token <token> --output converted_slack_data
./manage.py import '' converted_slack_data
```

This could take several minutes to run, depending on how much data you're
importing.

**Import options**

The commands above create an imported organization on the root domain
(`EXTERNAL_HOST`) of the Zulip installation. You can also import into a
custom subdomain, e.g. if you already have an existing organization on the
root domain. Replace the last line above with the following, after replacing
`<subdomain>` with the desired subdomain.

```
./manage.py import <subdomain> converted_slack_data
```

## Caveats

- Slack doesn't export private channels or direct messages unless you pay
  for Slack Plus or contact Slack support. See
  [Slack's documentation](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/204897248-Guide-to-Slack-import-and-export-tools)
  for more details.

- (Slack Plus import) Private channels and direct messages are currently
  not imported. We expect to address this in a future revision.

- (Slack Plus import) Message edit history is currently not imported.

- Slack doesn't export user settings or organization settings, so
  you'll need to configure these manually.

- Permission hierarchy:
    Slack's `Primary owner`, `owner`, and `admin` are mapped to Zulip's `Organization admin`.
    Slack's `Member`, `restricted`, and `ultra restricted` are mapped to regular Zulip users.
    `Channel creators` have no special permissions in Zulip.

- The "joined #channel_name" messages are not imported.
