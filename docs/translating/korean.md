## Terms

- history - **기록**
  
  *(Google, Youtube)*
  
  `Google: browsing history = 검색 기록`<br>
  `Youtube: watch history = 시청 기록`
  
   History can be translated with '역사', but it means study of past which is improper in this context. In this context, history is used similarly to record. There are a lot of Korean words that means record; '기록', '이력', '내역'. Many websites use '기록' to history because it is intuitive, so we choose to use it.

- linkifier - 

- message - **메시지**
  
  *(Naver, Google)*
  
  `Naver: 메시지 보내기`<br>
  `Google: Check your messages on your computer = 컴퓨터에서 메시지 확인하기`
  
- organization - **조직**
  
  *(Google)*
  
  `Google: Creating and Managing Organizations = 조직 생성 및 관리`
