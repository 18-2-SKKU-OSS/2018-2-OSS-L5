# The chat.zulip.org community

[https://chat.zulip.org](https://chat.zulip.org/) is the primary communication
forum for the Zulip community.

You can go through the simple signup process at that link, and then
you will soon be talking to core Zulip developers and other users.  To
get help in real time, you will have the best luck finding core
developers roughly between 17:00 UTC and 6:00 UTC, but the sun never
sets on the Zulip community.  Most questions get a reply within
minutes to a few hours, depending on the time of day.

## Community norms

* Send test messages to
  [#test here](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/7-test-here) or
  as a PM to yourself to avoid disturbing others.
* When asking for help, provide the details needed for others to help
  you.  E.g. include the full traceback in a code block (not a
  screenshot), a link to the code or a WIP PR you're having trouble
  debugging, etc.
* Ask questions on streams rather than PMing core contributors.
  You'll get answers faster since other people can help, and it makes
  it possible for other developers to learn from reading the discussion.
* Use @-mentions sparingly.  Unlike IRC or Slack, in Zulip, it's
  usually easy to see which message you're replying to, so you don't
  need to mention your conversation partner in every reply.
  Mentioning other users is great for timely questions or making sure
  someone who is not online sees your message.
* Converse informally; there's no need to use titles like "Sir" or "Madam".
* Use
  [gender-neutral language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender-neutral_language).
  For example, avoid using a pronoun like her or his in sentences like
  "Every developer should clean [their] keyboard at least once a week."
* Follow the community [code of conduct](../code-of-conduct.html).
* Participate!  Zulip is a friendly and welcoming community, and we
  love meeting new people, hearing about what brought them to Zulip,
  and getting their feedback.  If you're not sure where to start,
  introduce yourself and your interests in
  [#new members](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/95-new-members),
  using your name as the topic.

## High traffic community

The chat.zulip.org community sends several thousand messages every
single week, about half of them to streams that we have included in
the default streams for new users for discoverability.  Keeping up
with **everything** happening in the Zulip project is both difficult
and rarely a useful goal.

To make the best use of your time, we highly recommend that you
unsubscribe from streams that you aren't interested in, and mute
streams that are only of occasional interest.

## This is a bleeding edge development server

The chat.zulip.org server is frequently deployed off of `master` from
the Zulip Git repository, so please point out anything you notice that
seems wrong!  We catch many bugs that escape code review this way.

The chat.zulip.org server is a development and testing server, not a
production service, so don't use it for anything mission-critical,
secret/embarrassing, etc.

## Streams

There are a few streams worth highlighting that are relevant for
everyone, even non-developers:

* [#announce](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/1-announce) is for
  announcements and discussions thereof; we try to keep traffic there
  to a minimum.
* [#feedback](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/137-feedback) is for
  posting feedback on Zulip.
* [#design](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/101-design) is where we
  discuss UI and feature design and collect feedback on potential design
  changes.  We love feedback, so don't hesitate to speak up!
* [#user community](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/138-user-community) is
  for Zulip users to discuss their experiences using and adopting Zulip.
* [#production help](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/31-production-help)
  is for production environment related discussions.
* [#test here](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/7-test-here) is
  for sending test messages without inconveniencing other users :).
  We recommend muting this stream when not using it.

There are dozens of streams for development discussions in the Zulip
community (e.g. one for each app, etc.); check out the
[Streams page](https://chat.zulip.org/#streams/all) to see the
descriptions for all of them.  Relevant to almost everyone are these:

* [#checkins](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/65-checkins) is for
  progress updates on what you're working on and its status; usually
  folks post with their name as the topic.  Everyone is welcome to
  participate!
* [#development help](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/49-development-help)
  is for asking for help with any Zulip server/webapp development work
  (use the app streams for help working on one of the apps).
* [#code review](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/91-code-review)
  is for getting feedback on your work.  We encourage all developers
  to comment on work posted here, even if you're new to the Zulip
  project; reviewing other PRs is a great way to develop experience,
  and even just manually testing a proposed new feature and posting
  feedback is super helpful.
* [#documentation](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/19-documentation)
  is where we discuss improving Zulip's user, sysadmin, and developer
  documentation.
* [#translation](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/58-translation) is
  for discussing Zulip's translations.
* [#learning](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/92-learning) is for
  posting great learning resources one comes across.

## Chat meetings

We have regular chat meetings on Zulip to coordinate work on various
parts of the Zulip project.  While most developer discussions happen
asynchonrously, these meetings are used mainly to coordinate work
within a major area of Zulip.  These meetings are usually scheduled in
Pacific time mornings, since that seems to be the best time for our
global contributor base (the part of the world where it's the deep
middle of the night is the Pacific Ocean).

Anyone is welcome to attend and contribute to the discussions in these
meetings, and they're a great time to stop by and introduce yourself
if you'd like to get involved (though really, any time is, so).

Here are the regular meetings that exist today along with their usual
times:

* Mobile team on
[#mobile](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/48-mobile), generally
Wednesdays at 10AM Pacific time.

* Backend/infrastructure team on
[#backend](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/3-backend), generally
Fridays at 10AM Pacific time.

* Bots and integrations team on
[#integrations](https://chat.zulip.org/#narrow/stream/127-integrations),
generally Fridays at 9AM Pacific time.
