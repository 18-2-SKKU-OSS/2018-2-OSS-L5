# Version History

All notable changes to the Zulip server are documented in this file.

### Unreleased

This section lists notable unreleased changes; it is generally updated
in bursts.

### 1.9.0 -- 2018-11-07

**Highlights:**

- Support for Ubuntu bionic and Debian stretch (our first non-Ubuntu
  platform!).  We expect to deprecate support for installing a new
  Zulip server on Ubuntu Trusty in the coming months, in preparation
  for Trusty’s end-of-life in April 2019.
- New data import tools for HipChat and Gitter.  The Slack importer
  is now out of beta.
- Zulip Python process startup time is about 30% faster; this effort
  resulted in upstream contributions to fix significant performance
  bugs in django-bitfield, libthumbor, and pika.
- You can now configure custom (organization-specific) fields for user
  profiles; Zulip can now serve as your organization’s employee
  directory.
- Zulip now supports using Google Hangouts instead of Jitsi as the
  video chat provider.
- Users can now configure email and mobile push notifications for
  all messages in a stream (useful for low-traffic
  streams/organizations), not just for messages mentioning them.
- New [stream settings](https://zulipchat.com/help/stream-permissions)
  control whether private stream subscribers can access history
  from before they joined, and allow configuring streams to only
  allow administrators to post.
- Zulip now has experimental support for guest users (intended
  for use cases like contractors who the organization only wants
  to have access to a few streams).
- New native integrations for Ansible Tower, Appveyor, Clubhouse,
  Netlify, and Zabbix; Zulip now has over 100 native integrations (in
  addition to hundreds more available via Zapier and IFTTT).
- New translations for Ukrainian, Portuguese, Indonesian, Dutch, and
  Finnish.  Zulip now has complete or nearly-complete translations
  for German, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Russian, Ukrainian,
  Czech, Finnish, and Turkish.  Partial translations for Chinese,
  Dutch, Korean, Polish, Japanese, and Indonesian cover the majority
  of the total strings in the project.

**Upgrade notes:**

* Zulip 1.9 contains a significant database migration that can take
  several minutes to run.  The upgrade process automatically minimizes
  disruption by running this migration first, before beginning the
  user-facing downtime.  However, if you'd like to watch the downtime
  phase of the upgrade closely, we recommend
  [running them first manually](../production/expensive-migrations.html)
  and as well as the usual trick of
  [doing an apt upgrade first](../production/maintain-secure-upgrade.html#applying-system-updates).

**Full feature changelog:**
- Added an organization setting for message deletion time limits.
- Added an organization setting to control who can edit topics.
- Added ctrl+K keyboard shortcut for getting to search (same as /, but
  works even when you're inside compose).
- Renamed the hotkey for starring a message to Ctrl+S.
- Added the new `SOCIAL_AUTH_SUBDOMAIN` setting, which all servers using
  both GitHub authentication and hosting multiple Zulip organizations
  should set (see [the docs for details](../production/multiple-organizations.html#social-authentication)).
- Added automatic thumbnailing of images, powered by thumbor.  The new
  THUMBOR_URL setting controls this feature; it is disabled by default
  in this release, because the mobile apps don't support it yet.
- Added documentation on alternative production deployment options.

  organization administrators can remove users, edit descriptions, and
  rename private streams they are not subscribed to.  See Zulip's
  security model documentation for details.
- On Xenial, the local uploads backend now does the same security
  checks that the S3 backend did before serving files to users.
  Ubuntu Trusty's version of nginx is too old to support this and so
  the legacy model is the default; we recommend upgrading.
- Added an organization setting to limit creation of bots.

  now don't clutter the feed with the URL: we just display the image.
- Redesigned the API for emoji reactions to support the full range of
  how emoji reactions are used.

- Fixed numerous issues in the "stream settings" UI.
- Fixed numerous subtle bugs with the stream creation UI.
- Changes the URL scheme for stream narrows to encode the stream ID,
  so that they can be robust to streams being renamed.  The change is
  backwards-compatible; existing narrow URLs still work.


**API, bots, and integrations:**
- Rewrote our API documentation to be much more friendly and
  expansive; it now covers most important endpoints, with nice examples.

### 1.7.2 -- 2018-04-12

This is a security release, with a handful of cherry-picked changes
since 1.7.1.  All Zulip server admins are encouraged to upgrade
promptly.

- CVE-2018-9986: Fix XSS issues with frontend markdown processor.
- CVE-2018-9987: Fix XSS issue with muting notifications.
- CVE-2018-9990: Fix XSS issue with stream names in topic typeahead.
- CVE-2018-9999: Fix XSS issue with user uploads.  The fix for this
  adds a Content-Security-Policy for the `LOCAL_UPLOADS_DIR` storage
  backend for user-uploaded files.

Thanks to Suhas Sunil Gaikwad for reporting CVE-2018-9987 and w2w for
reporting CVE-2018-9986 and CVE-2018-9990.

### 1.7.1 -- 2017-11-21

This is a security release, with a handful of cherry-picked changes
since 1.7.0.  All Zulip server admins are encouraged to upgrade
promptly.

This release includes fixes for the upgrade process, so server admins
running a version from before 1.7 should upgrade directly to 1.7.1.

- CVE-2017-0910: On a server with multiple realms, a vulnerability in
  the invitation system allowed an authorized user of one realm to
  create an account on any other realm.
- The Korean translation is now complete, a huge advance from almost
  nothing in 1.7.0.  The French translation is now nearly complete,
  and several other languages have smaller updates.
- The installer now sets LC_ALL to a known locale, working around an
  issue where some dependencies fail to install in some locales.
- We fixed a bug in the script that runs after upgrading Zulip (so
  the fix applies when upgrading to this version), where the
  garbage-collection of old deployments sometimes wouldn't preserve
  the immediate last deployment.

### 1.7.0 -- 2017-10-25

**Highlights:**

Web
- We’ve completely redesigned our onboarding process to explain Zulip,
  and especially topics, to new users.
- We’ve built a beautiful new emoji picker with categories, a
  showcase, and much better data. Note the clean, underscore-free
  display!
- The emails sent by Zulip are more consistent, readable, and visually
  interesting.
- Chinese (Simplified) and Japanese join Spanish, German, and Czech in
  having the user interface fully translated, in addition to partial
  translations for many other languages. We also fixed many small
  issues where strings weren’t tagged for translation.
- Many pages have been redesigned to be easier to use and visually
  cleaner, including the settings pages and the user documentation at
  /help, /integrations, and /apps.

Mobile and Desktop support
- Zulip Server 1.7 adds several new APIs that are critical for mobile
  app performance and that let the app track unread messages. If
  you’re using the mobile apps at all (iOS or Android), you will
  definitely want to upgrade to Zulip 1.7.
- The iOS and Android apps can receive push notifications
  (configurable, naturally) for events like PMs and @-mentions. While
  Zulip Server 1.6 has basic support for these, 1.7 brings a new,
  clearer format to notifications, and gives each user more options
  for finer-grained control.
- The new Electron desktop app is out of beta and replaces our legacy
  desktop apps.

Backend and scaling
- Zulip now runs exclusively on Python 3.  This is the culmination of
  an 18-month migration effort.  We are very excited about this!
- We’ve added an automatic "soft deactivation" process, which
  dramatically improves performance for organizations with a large
  number of inactive users, without any impact on those users’
  experience if they later come back.
- Zulip's performance at scale has improved significantly. Performance
  now scales primarily with number of active users (not total
  users). As an example, chat.zulip.org serves 400 monthly active
  users and about 3500 total users, on one VM with just 8GB of RAM and
  a CPU consistently over 90% idle.

**Upgrade notes:**

* Zulip 1.7 contains some significant database migrations that can
  take several minutes to run.  The upgrade process automatically
  minimizes disruption by running these first, before beginning the
  user-facing downtime.  However, if you'd like to watch the downtime
  phase of the upgrade closely, we recommend
  [running them first manually](../production/expensive-migrations.html) and as well
  as the usual trick of
  [doing an apt upgrade first](../production/maintain-secure-upgrade.html#applying-system-updates).

* We've removed support for an uncommon legacy deployment model where
  a Zulip server served multiple organizations on the same domain.
  Installs with multiple organizations now require each organization
  to have its own subdomain.

  This change should have no effect for the vast majority of Zulip
  servers that only have one organization.  If you manage a server
  that hosts multiple organizations, you'll want to read [our guide on
  multiple organizations](../production/multiple-organizations.html).

* We simplified the configuration for our password strength checker to
  be much more intuitive.  If you were using the
  `PASSWORD_MIN_ZXCVBN_QUALITY` setting,
  [it has been replaced](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/commit/a116303604e362796afa54b5d923ea5312b2ea23) by
  the more intuitive `PASSWORD_MIN_GUESSES`.
